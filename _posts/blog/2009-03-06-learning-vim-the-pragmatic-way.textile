title: Learning Vim The Pragmatic Way
---

Due to popular inexorability, I'm learning to use the "Vim" text editor(specifically "MacVim":http://code.google.com/p/macvim/). 
Having recently finished "Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1934356050?ie=UTF8&tag=joemart-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1934356050, I decided to follow one of the suggestions and mind map this new information.

The mind map turned out pretty good. This one includes the basic commands, which I'll update with the more advanced stuff as I learn it. I made a large version to hang next to my screen. Here's a preview:

You can download the full version as a PDF "here":/attachments/Vim.pdf. Also, if you want, you can work on this mind map some more by importing "the OPML":/attachments/Vim.opml for it into whatever software you use.

PS: Yes, I wrote this post in Vim :)
