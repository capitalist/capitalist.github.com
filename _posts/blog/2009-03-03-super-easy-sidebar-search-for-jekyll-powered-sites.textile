title: Super Easy Search For Jekyll Powered Sites
---

Site search is one of the most important missing features when moving your blog off of a blog engine to a static site. I'm using "Jekyll":http://http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/ to churn out the pages for this site, but wanted back my missing search.

h3. This post brought to you courtesy of the Google Search AJAX API...

As it turns out, I need only to drop in the AJAX powered Google search and it just works. Here's how.

# First, head on over to "Google Code":http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/signup.html and get an API key.
# Then, make yourself an include file named google_ajax_search.html (create the _includes directory in the root of your Jekyll project if you don't have one).
# Next, add this code to the file you just created and substitute your api key and url:
{% highlight html %}
<script src="http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=your_api_key" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script language="Javascript" type="text/javascript">
  
  google.load("search", "1");
  
  function OnLoad() {
    // Create a search control
    var searchControl = new google.search.SearchControl();
    
    // Add in a WebSearch
    var webSearch = new google.search.WebSearch();
    
    // Restrict our search to pages from this site
    webSearch.setSiteRestriction('your site url');
    
    // Add the searcher to the SearchControl
    searchControl.addSearcher(webSearch);
    
    // tell the searcher to draw itself and tell it where to attach
    searchControl.draw(document.getElementById("search"));
  }
  google.setOnLoadCallback(OnLoad);
  
</script>
{% endhighlight %}
# Now, create a div in your layout, with id="search" where you'd like the search box to appear.
# Lastly, include your google_ajax_search in the &lt;head&gt; of your layout.
